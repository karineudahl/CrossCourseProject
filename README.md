# Cross Course Project 

We have been working on this project through the first year of study. 


**Process**

1. Made Adobe XD design 
2. Made the site with HTML and CSS - had to change a lot in design because it was hard to code
3. Learned some JavaScript - added JavaScript 
4. Learned Interactive Design - had to do changes in design 
5. Learned Content Management System - made the products in a headless Wordpress, deplyed it on one.com via FileZilla
6. Had to change the HTML and JavaScript code to fetch the API instead of hardcoding the products
